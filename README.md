# MATLAB_digital_calculator
A digital calculator was made using MATLAB. It is capable of receiving a pair of numbers in four different numeric systems and return any of the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), as requested by the user. Different functions were used, implemented in a GUIDE, to handle the program easily and intuitively.
